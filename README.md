## Massively Parallel Hashing on Multi-GPU Nodes

> "Warp speed, Mister Sulu." - **Captain James Tiberius Kirk**

## Introduction
WarpDrive is a single- and multi-GPU hash table implementation written in C++ and CUDA-C.
We provide a novel open-addressing probing scheme which adheres closely to the warp execution model of modern CUDA-enabled accelerators.
